My first Capstone Project, completed on 6/9/24, for Day 11 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b><br><br>
The biggest challenge was visualising the flow of the code. At the start, I jumped straight into coding without any planning and the code got very messy.
It was very frustrating so I took a long break. After returning, I copied the code to my notepad and started from scratch.
This time I made a flowchart and was very clear on the functions I need.
To be honest, I took a very sneak peek at the solution when I ran into a road block and used chatgpt whenever my code got an error that I can't figure out.
My code ended up differing quite a bit from the intended solution but I am very proud that it works!<br>

Coding project for Day 12 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 7/9/24.<br><br>
Relatively straightforward activity but I noticed that the solution tend to put the entire code as a function, e.g. def game(), while I like to type the code outside of a function, but both ways work (for now).
