First Capstone Project, completed on 6/9/24, for Day 11 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b><br><br>
The biggest challenge was visualising the flow of the code. At the start, I jumped straight into coding without any planning and the code got very messy.
It was very frustrating so I took a long break. After returning, I copied the code to my notepad and started from scratch.
This time I made a flowchart and was very clear on the functions I need.
My code ended up differing quite a bit from the intended solution but I am very proud that it works!<br>

Coding project for Day 12 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 7/9/24.<br><br>
Relatively straightforward but I noticed that the solution tend to put the entire code as a function, e.g. def game(), while I like to type the main code outside of a function. Both ways work (for now).

Coding project for Day 14 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 9/9/24.<br><br>
PyCharm was a bit buggy today (did not let me insert new rows and new text would just overwrite old text) which made coding a lot more frustrating than usual. This coding practice drilled a lot on how to index from a list with nested dictionaries and I definitely had to go back to the previous lessons to remember how to do it. Getting a hang of creating functions and while loops.

Last of the Beginner projects before we move on to Intermediate! Day 15 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 10/9/24. <br><br>
It was a pretty large project and I completed it without looking at the solution at all this time! I followed the instructor's recommendation to break down the project into smaller tasks and it definitely made the project a lot more manageable. I also started using the debugging tool on PyCharm to help me visualise my code. Still need to figure out how to use it for actual debugging. Took >2 hours to complete (with a long break in between) but its a satisfying project.
