# BlackJack #
First Capstone Project, completed on 6/9/24, for Day 11 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b><br><br>
The biggest challenge was visualising the flow of the code. At the start, I jumped straight into coding without any planning and the code got very messy.
It was very frustrating so I took a long break. After returning, I copied the code to my notepad and started from scratch.
This time I made a flowchart and was very clear on the functions I need.
My code ended up differing quite a bit from the intended solution but I am very proud that it works!<br>

Coding project for Day 12 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 7/9/24.<br><br>
Relatively straightforward but I noticed that the solution tend to put the entire code as a function, e.g. def game(), while I like to type the main code outside of a function. Both ways work (for now).

Coding project for Day 14 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 9/9/24.<br><br>
PyCharm was a bit buggy today (did not let me insert new rows and new text would just overwrite old text) which made coding a lot more frustrating than usual. This coding practice drilled a lot on how to index from a list with nested dictionaries and I definitely had to go back to the previous lessons to remember how to do it. Getting a hang of creating functions and while loops.

# Coffee Machine #
Day 15 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 10/9/24. Last of the Beginner projects before we move on to Intermediate! <br><br>
It was a pretty large project and I completed it without looking at the solution at all this time! I followed the instructor's recommendation to break down the project into smaller tasks and it definitely made the project a lot more manageable. I also started using the debugging tool on PyCharm to help me visualise my code. Still need to figure out how to use it for actual debugging. Took >2 hours to complete (with a long break in between) but its a satisfying project. 

# Hirst Painting #

Day 18 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 15/9/24. The project was relatively straightforward but it took me 2 days to complete due to school commitment. The main takeaway was learning to use documentation to write code in Turtle. Using Turtle made it easy to visualise the code. It was also cool to learn how to extract colors from an image using colorgram.py.

# Turtle Race #

Day 19 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 15/9/24 (Two in a day!) Another simple project using the Turtle Console but it was very fun to code and ended with an interactive product. The idea of creating independent objects using the same class is easy to grasp. However, my first instinct was to create 6 different turtles by copy pasting the same set of code, but realised that there's probably a more efficient way of creating the turtles. Controlling the turtles was another challenge but this project has definitely reinforced what I have previously learned about for loops.

# Snake Game # 

Day 20 and 21 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b> !! Disclaimer: Did this more of a follow along tutorial rather than an independent task.<br>

This was probably one of the more complex projects in the course thus far as we had to create the classes from scratch. While there were many ways to write the code, I found that I had to stick with the tutorial in order to keep up with the new concepts I was learning. Definitely fun to form the different classes that make up the Snake Game. Looking forward to re-creating something similar on my own.
