# BlackJack #
First Capstone Project, completed on 6/9/24, for Day 11 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b><br><br>
The biggest challenge was visualising the flow of the code. At the start, I jumped straight into coding without any planning and the code got very messy.
It was very frustrating so I took a long break. After returning, I copied the code to my notepad and started from scratch.
This time I made a flowchart and was very clear on the functions I need.
My code ended up differing quite a bit from the intended solution but I am very proud that it works!<br>

# Guess the Number #
Coding project for Day 12 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 7/9/24.<br><br>
Relatively straightforward but I noticed that the solution tend to put the entire code as a function, e.g. def game(), while I like to type the main code outside of a function. Both ways work (for now).

# Higher Lower #
Coding project for Day 14 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 9/9/24.<br><br>
PyCharm was a bit buggy today (did not let me insert new rows and new text would just overwrite old text) which made coding a lot more frustrating than usual. This coding practice drilled a lot on how to index from a list with nested dictionaries and I definitely had to go back to the previous lessons to remember how to do it. Getting a hang of creating functions and while loops.

# Coffee Machine #
Day 15 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 10/9/24. Last of the Beginner projects before we move on to Intermediate! <br><br>
It was a pretty large project and I completed it without looking at the solution at all this time! I followed the instructor's recommendation to break down the project into smaller tasks and it definitely made the project a lot more manageable. I also started using the debugging tool on PyCharm to help me visualise my code. Still need to figure out how to use it for actual debugging. Took >2 hours to complete (with a long break in between) but its a satisfying project. 

# Hirst Painting #

Day 18 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 15/9/24. The project was relatively straightforward but it took me 2 days to complete due to school commitment. The main takeaway was learning to use documentation to write code in Turtle. Using Turtle made it easy to visualise the code. It was also cool to learn how to extract colors from an image using colorgram.py.

# Turtle Race #

Day 19 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 15/9/24 (Two in a day!) Another simple project using the Turtle Console but it was very fun to code and ended with an interactive product. The idea of creating independent objects using the same class is easy to grasp. However, my first instinct was to create 6 different turtles by copy pasting the same set of code, but realised that there's probably a more efficient way of creating the turtles. Controlling the turtles was another challenge but this project has definitely reinforced what I have previously learned about for loops.

# Snake Game # 

Day 20 and 21 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 16/9/24 !! Disclaimer: Did this more of a follow along tutorial rather than an independent task.<br>

This was probably one of the more complex projects in the course thus far as we had to create the classes from scratch. While there were many ways to write the code, I found that I had to stick with the tutorial in order to keep up with the new concepts I was learning. Definitely fun to form the different classes that make up the Snake Game. Looking forward to re-creating something similar on my own. 

# Pong #

Day 22 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 17/9/24. Like the snake game, the project was broken down into smaller challenges and I tried my best to attempt each challenge on my own before seeing the solution. Trying to solve the challenges felt like mental gymnastics. One of the most frustrating obstacles I faced was figuring out why the ball wasn't moving, even though the code seemed error-free. After extensive research and some guidance from ChatGPT, I discovered that the issue stemmed from incorrectly redefining the self attribute in a subclass. <br>

I initially assumed that the concepts I learned from the Snake game would seamlessly translate to the Pong game. However, I quickly realized that coding isn't always about applying a fixed template. Each project brings its own set of unique challenges, requiring flexibility and adaptation beyond standard patterns. I hope that problem solving would come more intuitively as I code more.

# Turtle Crossing #

Another Capstone Project for Day 23 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 18/9/24. Proud to say I managed to complete most of the coding by myself by referencing the code from the previous two projects! It was a huge struggle trying to figure out how to generate the car obstacles and make them move and ended up referring to the solution. The rest of the tasks were manageable and really fun to code. Tried out a Pomodoro Timer to manage my time and it definitely helped me focus and complete the entire project in 1.5 hr.

# Mail Merge #

Day 24 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 19/9/24. Was very excited for this project because (1) we are finally moving away from Turtle console and (2) mail merge was a feature I discovered at a previous job that was a HUGE gamechanger. In this lesson, we learnt how to open, read and write to files. Took me less than 30 minutes to complete the challenge and I felt that it was a lot simplier than I expected it to be. Note: I should have used the readlines() feature instead of append() to extract the list of names but both works.

# US States Game #

Moving on the Python packages on Day 25 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 20/9/24. I previously learnt about pandas package from a Data Science bootcamp I really attended so today's lesson was a good refresher for me to further reinforce the knowledge. Struggled a little on indexing rows from a DataFrame and learnt about the importance of using .item() when pulling values from a Series. Day 25 was a very long lesson but the project was manageable.

# Miles to KM Converter #

Day 27 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 22/9/24. Today's lesson was on arguments, e.g. optional arguments, many positional arguments (*args) and many keyword arguments (**kwargs). It was quite unrelated to the project of the day which was to create a GUI for a distance converter. Managed to complete the challenge on my own and made use of stack overflow as well as the documentation to figure out how to adjust the attributes, such as as color and padding, of the different elements.

# Pomodoro Timer #

Day 28 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 23/9/24. Created a really cute Pomodoro timer, which is pretty "timely" considering I just learnt about Pomodoro timers a few days ago! The Pomodoro timer is basically a very useful time management tool that works on a 25 mins work - 5 mins rest cycle with a longer break after 4 work-rest cycles (but I rarely get to that point). Disclaimer: This project was more of a follow-along tutorial with some challenges here and there. It was more challenging than the other projects because I was not familiar with Tkinter yet and there were a lot of moving parts, i.e. the timer. However, I managed to code the entire UI independently using what was taught in the previous lesson. One huge mistake I made today was forgetting to call the global variable when using it in a function. Took me way too long scratching my head over why my code was coming back with an error, but I'm glad I figured it out! Good to learn it the hard way now!

# Password Manager #

Day 29 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 24/9/24. Created a Password Manager App using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). There were multiple elements to this project, namely (1) coding the UI, (2) saving the password to a file and (3) generating a random password and copying it to the clipboard. I am proud to say I was able to complete each task independently and with relative ease. I particularly enjoyed creating the UI as it was so satisying arranging the different elements into its position.<br>

Also fun fact, I solved the "bug" from Day 14! Its caused by pressing "Insert" on my keyboard. Have been "fixing the bug" by closing and opening PyCharm again, which was a very bandaid-like quick fix. Turns out I just needed to google to find the solution. Everyday I learn something new!
